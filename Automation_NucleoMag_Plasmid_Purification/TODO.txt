Consider multiple sample procedure:
Are volumina in 1.5mL eppi enough? For how many samples?
Can the first steps before time critical step be made with multitransfer and 1mL pipette? If not how do we make a priority
queue?
How do we make an interface for user to specify the amount of samples?

Make an overview sheet to show how the protocol has to be used.
